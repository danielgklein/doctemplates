# doctemplates

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of doctemplates is to provide some basic document templates useful to grad students for R Markdown. These documents are basic and highly customizable to one's needs. _Currently, the only template provided is for an academic paper, but planned additions include presentations and memos._

## Installation

You can install doctemplates from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("danielgklein/doctemplates")
```
```
library(doctemplates)
```

## Use

Once `doctemplates` is installed, you can begin using the pre-built templates.

First, create a new R Markdown file: either select the green + mark in the upper left corner of your session, or navigate to `File` > `New File` > `R Markdown`. Select `From Template` on the left side of the dialogue menu that opens. Each `doctemplates` template should appear.
