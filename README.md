The goal of doctemplates is to provide some basic document templates
useful to grad students for R Markdown. These documents are basic and
highly customizable to oneâ€™s needs. *Currently, the only template
provided is for an academic paper, but planned additions include
presentations and memos.*

## Installation

You can install doctemplates from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
devtools::install_github("danielgklein/doctemplates")
```

    library(doctemplates)

## Use

Once `doctemplates` is installed, you can begin using the pre-built
templates.

First, create a new R Markdown file: either select the green + mark in
the upper left corner of your session, or navigate to `File` \>
`New File` \> `R Markdown`. Select `From Template` on the left side of
the dialogue menu that opens. Each `doctemplates` template should
appear.
